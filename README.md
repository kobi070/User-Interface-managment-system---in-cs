Hierarchical Menu Management System for Console Applications
This project is a software component that assists in the display and management of hierarchical menus for console applications. It allows users to interact with various menus in a consistent and intuitive way.

The component was implemented using two different approaches: interfaces and delegations. The Interfaces folder contains the code for the interface-based implementation, while the Delegations folder contains the code for the delegation-based implementation.
